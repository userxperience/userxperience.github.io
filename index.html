      ICT and me
      <hr>
    </h1>

    <p>
      I vaguely remember my first ICT problem being a cartridge on my Gameboy Advanced that didn't work properly. <br>
      It was easily fixed by just blowing air into it and inserting it again, and
      while it <br> was a simple solution it still gave me the same satisfaction I feel today when I fix a more
      complicated issue.<br>
      Later on I remember disassembling my old PS2 (we had just gotten a brand new PS3) and I was fascinated by how
      complicated it was.<br>
      These days my personal ICT experience is mainly helping family and friends with computer-related issues and I
      really enjoy<br> being helpful in this manner. <br>
      I have also dabbled in pc-building and while my current setup has depressingly low specs, <br>
      like most gamers I dream of one day running a game at the highest graphics.<br>
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      The reason I like this study so far is because I enjoy the freedom it gives you. I graduated from middle school
      only last year so this is a big contrast to my previous experiences. <br>
      I try to only ask the teachers if it is absolutely necessary because I like solving issues on my own.
      I'm also interested in learning more about how things in <br>the ICT field work and I've really enjoyed creating
      this website as well.<br>
      Some of the things I'd like to learn more about are:
    <ul>
      <li>javascript</li>
      <li>html</li>
      <li>bootstrap</li>
      <li>css</li>
      <li>security</li>
      <li>graphic design</li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    </p>
    <p>
    <h2>My motivation</h2>
    My motivation for ICT is just the intrinsic desire to learn more. Ever since I was young have tried different things
    on my PC which were new to me, from modding games do editing my BIOS settings to run a virtual machine. Once i eventually solved the issues i ran into, it was really satisfying once i had solved the issues i wanted to solve, which is my main motivation for wanting to learn more.<br>
    Below are two images of previous programming "projects"; the first being a website we made for school that displayed
    temperatures. Sadly, it doesn't work anymore because the thermometers it was connected to were shut off.
    <br> The second one is a home project that combines random groups of food to create a meal. The programme can be
    used <a href="foodgenerator.html">here</a>. However, please mind that this was a home project made in a day before
    starting this course.</p>
