    ICT and me
  </h1>

  <main>
    <p>
      I vaguely remember my first ICT problem being a cartridge on my Gameboy Advanced that didn't work properly. <br>
      It was easily fixed by just blowing air into it and inserting it again, and  
      while it <br> was a simple solution it still gave me the same satisfaction I feel today when I fix a more complicated issue.<br>
      Later on I remember disassembling my old PS2 (we had just gotten a brand new PS3) and I was fascinated by how complicated it was.<br>
      These days my personal ICT experience is mainly helping family and friends with computer-related issues and I really enjoy being helpful in this manner. <br> 
      I have also dabbled in pc-building and while my current setup has depressingly low specs, <br>
      like most gamers I dream of one day running a game at the highest graphics.<br>
    </p> 
   <br> 
   <p>
    The reason I like this study so far is because I enjoy the freedom it gives you. I graduated from middle school only last year so this is a big contrast to my previous experiences. <br>
    I try to only ask the teachers if it is absolutely nessecary because I like solving issues on my own.
    I'm also interested in learning more about how things in <br>the ICT field work and I've really enjoyed creating this website as well.<br> 
    some of the things i'd like to learn more about are:
    <ul>
      <li>javascript</li>
      <li>html</li>
      <li>bootstrap</li>
      <li>css</li>
      <li>security</li>
      <li>graphic design</li>
    </ul>
