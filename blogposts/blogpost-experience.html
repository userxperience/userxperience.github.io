  My programming experiences
</h1>
<hr>
<p>
  I didn't dive into this course cluelessly, as I have a small amount of programming experience on my own.
  When I was in middle school, I took a course in infomatica which required us to create a website that displayed the temperatures of some classrooms at our school.
  The website didn't look too good as we hadn't really learned how HTML or CSS worked yet.
  I think the website used javascript as well but the main thing I remember is blindly following the instructions without thinking about it too hard.<br><br>
  The next "project" I worked on was something I made for fun, I wanted to create something that randomly combined three foods, all from different pre-defined groups.
  this was made in javascript and displayed in HTML, but the javascript part was mostly copy-pasting from various tutorials I could find. However, I did end up making a functional meal generator, so I'm still proud of it.
<br><br>
So that's about it. Apart from these two brief peeks behind the programming veil, i'm still new to ICT. what I can say, however, is that in this week i have already learned more than both of my previous programming escapades combined.
